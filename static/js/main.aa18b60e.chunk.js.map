This often stems from the difficulty of organic waste management & transport between business owners and waste management companies. Business owners find that waste collation is not frequent or variable enough, while waste management companies find that they lack an efficient system in collecting waste.\n      </div>\n\n      <h2 class=\"title-3\"> 🔍 Context </h2>\n      <div class=\"about-content\">\n        Desjardins' Cooperathon is the largest Open Innovation challenge in\n        Canada often with projects driven by social change across a multitude of\n        categories. In 2019, I joined their national competition with no team\n        and no idea.\n        <Break />\n        The competition was structured with biweekly sprints for approximately 3\n        months, where you would also receive biweekly design thinking workshops.\n        <Break />\n        I was part of a four-person team formation with the grand scheme to\n        somehow reduce food waste in Canada and so the journey began. We spent\n        weeks iterating over producting, with consistent evolution, divergence\n        and convergence. It took multiple cycles and even more stakeholder\n        interviews before we landed on a prototype and business model.\n        <Break />\n        Upon presenting it at the provincial competition, we came first place\n        and were the only team to make it to the national competition/finals in\n        Montreal.\n      </div>\n\n      <h2 class=\"title-3\"> 📚 Research & Personas </h2>\n      <div class=\"about-content\">\n        25 million tonnes of organic waste were sent to the landfills by\n        Canadians alone in 2016. That’s equivalent to the amount of emissions\n        produced by 56 million cars. It takes 15 years for these to break down,\n        all the while releasing harmful methane gases into the atmosphere.\n        <Break />\n        There are two major stakeholders involved in organic waste. Business\n        owners that produce the organic waste and waste management companies\n        that collect the organic waste.\n        <Break />\n        Business owners will often place their organic waste in their regular\n        waste bins, which causes the waste to end up in landfills as opposed to\n        being put towards more cyclic use. The reason is that the largest pain\n        point organic waste producing businesses face is the lack of frequency\n        and the rigid schedule that organic waste pick-up occurs in the city. \n        Take Laura as an example, the business owner.\n\n        <img src={st18}/>\n\n        <Break />\n        Waste management companies on the other hand, face a different issue.\n        They find that they do not have the resources in terms of fleet to\n        collect all the organic waste. They also find that often, their routes\n        are too inconvenient to embark on and that whether a business has\n        organic waste or not seemed random and inconsistent.\n\n      <img src={st19}/>\n        \n      </div>\n      <div class=\"about-content\">\n        Our solution consists of a mobile/tablet application for businesses to\n        connect to waste management companies via unified service.\n        <img src={st4} />\n        \n        The application consists of a short set-up for business owners to create\n        their accounts, create a request for an organic waste pick-up and view\n        their insights/progress on their waste management.\n        <img src={st12} />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"about-content\">\n        The great part about this software-as-a-service is that it allows users\n        to schedule pick-ups as frequently as they see fit and on the variable\n        days that seem most suitable depending on their forecasted organic waste\n        production.\n        <Break />\n        This also is a large win for the waste management companies. Since all\n        the request are processed within the same platform and network, the\n        application can then provide optimized routes every morning for the\n        fleet to embark on such that each truck is taking the shortest route\n        possible with an estimated capacity. This scatters out the fleet to be\n        used most efficiently in order to maximize savings for the waste\n        management companies, reduce organic waste gone to the landfill for\n        business owners and, most importantly, it closes the loop from the\n        source back the source.

We called this the research phase.\n                    <Break/>\n                    Often clients will come with a set of pain points or aspirations, which are incorporated into the research. At this stage, we would also complete stakeholder interviews, as well as customer surveying, should there be a need.\n                    <Break/>\n                    Upon attaining a revised high-level goal and expected deliverable, we would seek the support of subject matter advisors (SMAs) in order to help curate and create workshop activities and agendas.\n                    <Break/>\n                    The workshops oftened contained and were limited to brainstorming, ideation and divergence/convergence activities with human-centric/empathetic intentions. Before the pandemic, the workshops were exclusively in-person engagements that would often span one to three full working days. They often required a multitude of sticky notes and activity posters. Now that workshops are delivered digitally, virtual whiteboarding tools such as Mural are used and are at most 4 hours in length.\n                    \n                    <img src={hub3}/>\n                    \n                </div>\n\n\n\n                <h2 class=\"title-3\"> 🔦 Highlight </h2>\n\n                <div class=\"about-content\">\n                    I really enjoyed the immersive experience that this role provided.
