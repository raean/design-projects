In 2019, I joined their national competition with no team and no idea.\n                    <Break/>\n                    The competition was structured with biweekly sprints for approximately 3 months, where you would also receive biweekly design thinking workshops.\n                    <Break/>\n                    I was part of a four-person team formation with the grand scheme to somehow reduce food waste in Canada and so the journey began. We spent weeks iterating over producting, with consistent evolution, divergence and convergence. It took multiple cycles and even more stakeholder interviews before we landed on a prototype and business model.\n                    \n                    <Break/>\n                    Upon presenting it at the provincial competition, we came first place and were the only team to make it to the national competition/finals in Montreal. \n\n                    <img style={{width: \"400px\"}} src={st9}/>\n\n               </div>\n\n               <h2 class=\"title-3\"> 📱 Product Description/Pitch </h2>\n               <div class=\"about-content\">\n                    \n                    25 million tonnes of organic waste were sent to the landfills by Canadians alone in 2016. That’s equivalent to the amount of emissions produced by 56 million cars. It takes 15 years for these to break down, all the while releasing harmful methane gases into the atmosphere.\n                    <Break/>\n                    There are two major stakeholders involved in organic waste. Business owners that produce the organic waste and waste management companies that collect the organic waste.\n                    <Break/>\n                    Business owners will often place their organic waste in their regular waste bins, which causes the waste to end up in landfills as opposed to being put towards more cyclic use. The reason is that the largest pain point organic waste producing businesses face is the lack of frequency and the rigid schedule that organic waste pick-up occurs in the city.\n                    <Break/>\n                    Waste management companies on the other hand, face a different issue. They find that they do not have the resources in terms of fleet to collect all the organic waste. They also find that often, their routes are too inconvenient to embark on and that whether a business has organic waste or not seemed random and inconsistent. \n\n                    <img src={st4}/>\n\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"about-content\">\n                    \n                    Our solution consists of a mobile/tablet application for businesses to connect to waste management companies via unified service. \n                    <Break/>\n                    The application consists of a short set-up for business owners to create their accounts, create a request for an organic waste pick-up and view their insights/progress on their waste management.\n\n                    <img src={st12}/>\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"about-content\">\n\n                    The great part about this software-as-a-service is that it allows users to schedule pick-ups as frequently as they see fit and on the variable days that seem most suitable depending on their forecasted organic waste production. \n                    <Break/>\n                    This also is a large win for the waste management companies. Since all the request are processed within the same platform and network, the application can then provide optimized routes every morning for the fleet to embark on such that each truck is taking the shortest route possible with an estimated capacity.\n\n                    This scatters out the fleet to be used most efficiently in order to maximize savings for the waste management companies, reduce organic waste gone to the landfill for business owners and, most importantly, it closes the loop from the source back the source. How might it complete this?\n                    <img style={{width: \"900px\"}} src={st14}/>\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"about-content\">\n                    \n                    As organic waste is collected from businesses, more of it can be distributed to biogas plants in order to convert it into renewable natural gas that can be used for heat, electricity and as fuel. There are also instances of waste being collected and reused in other means.\n\n                    <img src={st15}/>\n\n               </div>\n\n               <h2 class=\"title-3\"> 📙 Design Process & Challenges  </h2>\n\n               <div class=\"about-content\">\n                     We spent weeks at the start of the competition researching and generating ideas that stemmed from non-perishable food donation programs to coffee ground collection services for cosmetics. We eventually landed on handling organic waste after in-depth market research and the opportunity to interiew an executive chef, a civic innovation strategist and multiple food franchise owners.\n                        <Break/>\n                    We found that outside of social motivation, business owners lacked an incentive to take care of their organic waste more effectively. In addition to upcoming regulations, we would be open to rewarding businesses with revenue in order to create a positive reinforcement loop.\n                    <Break/>\n                    At the time this portfolio piece was published, the product & service is still ongoing multiple iterations and receiving consistent feedback from multiple stakeholders.
