               <div class="about-content" >
                    <i> I joined The Canada Innovation Hub at Accenture as a Junior Innovation Designer and delivered over 20 workshops across 8 different clients, primarly within the public sector and retail space. Within this role, I facilitated, designed and led workshops with executive members of both the client teams and Accenture's internal teams. </i>

                <div class="about-content" >
                    A typical engagement within the role involved working with a Lead Designer in order to identify the current state of the client, both within their market and within their relationship with Accenture. We called this the research phase.
                    <Break/>
                    Often clients will come with a set of pain points or aspirations, which are incorporated into the research. At this stage, we would also complete stakeholder interviews, as well as customer surveying, should there be a need.
                    <Break/>
                    Upon attaining a revised high-level goal and expected deliverable, we would seek the support of subject matter advisors (SMAs) in order to help curate and create workshop activities and agendas.
                    <Break/>
                    The workshops oftened contained and were limited to brainstorming, ideation and divergence/convergence activities with human-centric/empathetic intentions. Before the pandemic, the workshops were exclusively in-person engagements that would often span one to three full working days. They often required a multitude of sticky notes and activity posters. Now that workshops are delivered digitally, virtual whiteboarding tools such as Mural are used and are at most 4 hours in length.

                <h2 class="title-3"> üî¶ Highlight </h2>

                <div class="about-content">
                    I really enjoyed the immersive experience that this role provided. I learned a lot about design thinking and workshop facilitation. It helped improve my presentation skills as well as my ability to keep a room of attendees present and engaged.
                    <Break/>
                    I also learned the enormous responsibilities that come wit corporate work. Administrative tasks, documentation and detail-oritented work were of critical importance within the role given the seniority of the clients as well as the external image of the team.
                    <Break/>
                    My most eventful highlight was presenting curated analytics from an employee survey I desigend to C-suite client members. This informed and aided them as they continued the workshop's activities, and the overall digital transformation of their organization.
